# nothing-cli

## `find`

Recursively walks from the current working directory, detects every directory containing a `build.js`, and prints a ‚úÖ/‚ùå depending on whether that repo‚Äôs second-to-last commit (HEAD~1) matches the latest commit hash in `~/Code/nothing-static`. Prints üéâ Pando! when all projects pass.

## `refactor`

Migrates an existing project to the nothing-static standard. Clones nothing-static, applies project customizations according to `files.csv` rules (lock/merge/skip), copies project-specific files, preserves git history with project‚Äôs first commit message as title and full timestamped history in description, and perserves remotes in `{projectName}-refactored` directory.

## `update`

Updates a refactored project to the latest nothing-static. Finds the original nothing-static base commit, fetches the latest from GitHub, creates a backup branch, and rebases all project commits onto the new base.

## `init`

Clones nothing-static to start a new project. Prompts for project name (used for directory and package.json) and optional domain. If domain provided, creates CNAME file and removes base URL logic from build.js. Creates initial commit.
